    <p>
      In 1914, as the guns of August began to rain destruction on Europe, another war was started in the South. 
      Twenty-eight men, led by Sir Earnest Shackle, sought to battle the elements on a quest to make the first 
      transcontinental Antarctic crossing in history. Shackleton was determined that this ambitious expedition 
      be his crowning achievement, but found only an environment cruel in it’s inhospitality, an alien world 
      where the forces of nature conspire to crush the creations of man and his spirit alike…<br>
      <br>     
      What follows is a short elucidation of the progression from England through the frozen waste of the 
      Antarctic of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition and it’s leader, Sir Earnest Shackleton.<br> 
      <br>
      Optimistic beginnings quickly dissipated into harrowing, fraught hardships, only to resolve into one 
      of the most impressive and daring feats of survival and leadership in recorded history.

    <h2>A TIMELINE OF EVENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1909 – 1912 Shackleton became world famous after the return of the Nimrod Expedition in 1909, despite 
          being a technical failure for not achieving the expedition goals. During this time Shackleton never 
          settled on any particular career or employment, instead biding his time while following the progress 
          of ongoing Antarctic expeditions. After the success of Roald Amundsen in discovering the South Pole 
          removed that historic first from the table, leaving Shackleton to declare that the next work would be 
          “a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole”.</li>
      <li>1913 During this time preparations were being made to launch a new expedition. Shackleton sought 
          funding from several private parties and we met with limited success, but after securing a promise of 
          £10,000 from the British Government, he made his plans public.</li>
      <li>1914 To drum up pubic interest a detailed plan was issued early in 1914. The plan called for two ships 
          to land on opposite sides of the continent, with the main party striking from the Weddell Sea, nearest 
          to Argentina, and a supporting party landing in to Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea party would make the 
          attempt at the crossing, while the supporting party was tasked with setting up supply depots for the 
          last half of the journey. After being granted contributions for several wealthy backers, notably a sum 
          of £24,000 (current value £2,080,000) from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird, Shackleton had the 
          funds he needed to proceed.</li>
      <li>26 October, 1914 Endurance departs Buenos Aires for the South Atlantic, reaching South Georgia on 5 
          November. After a month-long stay in the Grytviken whaling station, Endurance sails for the Antarctic. 
          Shackleton originally wished to attempt the transcontinental crossing in the first season, 1914 -1915, 
          but realized this to be impractical. No notice of a change of plan was sent to the Ross Sea party, 
          however.</li>
      <li>7 December, 1914 The first pack ice is encountered at 57º 26´, a higher latitude than expected. 
          Endurance at times must maneuver to avoid collisions or entrapment. After nearly 2 weeks of slow going, 
          on 22 December channels opened to allow the ship steady progress southward.</li>
      <li>15 January, 1915 The coast of Antarctica is reached. A good landing place is found in a bay formed by 
          a giant glacier, but Shackleton deemed it too far north of Vashel Bay for a landing, a decision that 
          he would later regret. On 17 January Shackleton sights previously undiscovered land at 76º27´, naming 
          it Caird Coast, for his prime sponsor. The next day the ship was forced 14 miles westward by the pack 
          before being completely stopped. The Endurance was now at the mercy of the drifting ice.</li>
      <li>14 February Shackleton orders an attempt to carve a passage through the pack with picks, saws, 
          prickers, and ice-chisels. The men made no improvement to their predicament, however, and Shackleton 
          began to entertain the possibility of wintering on barren, shifting pack ice. On 21 February they 
          reached their most southernly latitude of 76º58´ and then began to move northward, away from their 
          goal.</li>
      <li>24 February Shackleton abandons hope of freedom from the ice and orders the ship routine to be 
          abandoned. The interior of Endurance is converted to winter quarters, and the sled dogs are housed in 
          ice kennels, or “dogloos”, on the pack. Shackleton now hopes that the drift will carry them northward 
          where the ship can eventually break free, and make another attempt to reach Vashel Bay during the 
          Antarctic spring.</li>
      <li>1 August After months of drifting slowly northward the pack begins to break up amidst heavy snow and high 
          winds. The shifting masses of ice exerted great pressure on Endurance, forcing itself under the keel and 
          causing a list to port. Shackleton writes: “The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. 
          Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger 
          [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed".</li>
      <li>30 September The ship experiences the worst squeeze yet, which captain Worsley likened to being “thrown 
          to and fro like a shuttlecock”. </li>
      <li>24 October After months under constant barrage from the crushing ice Endurance suffers a mortal blow. 
          The starboard side was forced agains a flow and timbers began to flex and splinter, creating sounds similar 
          to “heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns”. Failures below the waterline allowed water to pour into the 
          ship. For days the crew attempted to stabilize the hull and pump out the inflowing ocean, but there was 
          little hope of saving the wounded vessel. On 27 October Shackleton gives the order to abandon ship, a clear 
          signal that the objectives for the Endurance crew had changed from exploration to survival. The ship does 
          not sink all at once, allowing the crew to salvage useful items and materials as the vessel was slowly ground 
          to splinters over the course of several weeks.</li>
      <li>30 October Shackleton orders a march westward, towards one of several locations where he believed stockpiles 
          had been left from previous expeditions. Before the march began Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be 
          shot, which include the carpenter McNish’s cat, Mrs. Chippy. Carrying two of the ships lifeboats on sledges, 
          progress was not swift. In three days the party only covers 2 miles.</li>
      <li>1 November Shackleton abandons the march, deciding that the pack, described as a “labyrinth of hummocks and 
          ridges”, was too difficult to move across. The crew names the solid flow where their march ended “Ocean Camp”
          where they plan to wait for pack to break up.</li>
      <li>21 November Endurance totally disappears beneath the ice. The Endurance crew continued their drift, covering 
          up to seven miles a day, but the course turned slightly east of north, taking them further away from a 
          potential shelter location. Growing nervous about the prospects of reaching land, Shackleton orders another 
          march.</li> 
      <li>27 December The ship’s carpenter McNish refuses to work, citing that the Ship’s Articles were void upon 
          Endurance sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton admonishes him to return to work, but 
          the episode soured the relationship between the two men for the rest of their ordeal.</li> 
      <li>29 December The march is halted after making only seven and a half miles progress. Shackleton observes that 
          it would take over three hundred days to reach land at that rate. The men make a new camp, which Shackleton 
          names “Patience Camp”. They will stay there for over three months. Supplies ran low and all of the remaining 
          animals were shot during this period, as they required more seal meat than could be found. A third lifeboat 
          was recovered during a foray back to Ocean Camp.</li>
      <li>17 March The men pass as close as 60 miles from Paulet Island, where there is a large food depot, but 
          remained inaccessible due to the rough, broken terrain of the sea ice.</li> 
      <li>8 April The Patience Camp floe suddenly splits, leaving just a small triangular raft of ice. Any further 
          fracturing would mean disaster, so Shackleton ordered the party and their gear into the lifeboats. This 
          development was not unexpected; Shackleton knew that eventually an open-water voyage would be necessary to 
          reach one of the South Shetland islands, where there was a chance for rescue from passing whaling vessels 
          from South Georgia island</li>.
      <li>15 April Landing on Elephant island.</li>
      <li>24 April Launching of the James Caird.</li>
      <li>5 May Shackelton encounters the largest waves he’s ever seen in all his years at sea, nearly destroying the 
          lifeboat. Three days later South Georgia is sighted, but it will be another two days of struggle against the 
          wind and waves before the men could come ashore.</li> 
      <li>8 May The crew of the James Caird took advantage of the solid ground to rest and recuperate as best they 
          could while Shackleton considered his next course of action. Due to the sorry condition of the lifeboat it 
          was decided that making an overland march to the Stromness whaling station on the northern coast was the 
          most sensible action.</li>
      <li>19 May At two o’clock, hours before dawn, Shackleton and two other men, Crean and Worsley, started their 
          ascent into the interior of South George island. This area of the island was unexplored, requiring the men 
          to improvise their route. Traveling by moonlight, the three men crossed crevasse-riddled glaciers and rocky 
          crags. This was as dangerous a moment as any yet faced by Shackleton, or his crew, for their survival 
          depended on the men of the James Caird reaching help at the whaling station. If he and his party disappeared 
          into the frozen terrain, so would any hope of rescue for the men waiting on Elephant Island.</li>
